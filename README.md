## The problem

I can't find any open source identification cards validator for PH ids

## This solution

I created this tool to help you validate your PH id cards.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install ph-id-validator
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { isSSSId } from 'ph-id-validator'

isTinId("123-456-789-123") // true
```

## Other Solutions

I can't find any open source solution for this problem. But If I found one I'll list it here.
